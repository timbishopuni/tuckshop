### STEP 8 IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP
8. Open the **.csv** file you just saved in Microsoft Excel, and go to **File** -> **Save As**, and save the file as **tuckshop.xlsx**. Ensure that the file type is Excel Workbook (**.xlsx**).

10. Move the **tuckshop.jar** and the new **tuckshop.xlsx** file into this folder.
11. Double click the **tuckshop.jar** file to run it.
12. After it completes, it should produce a new PDF file called **tuckshop.pdf**. This file contains the labels that can now be printed for use.

1. While holding the **Shift** key on your keyboard, right click on the **tuckshop** folder you made and select **Open a command window here**.
2. Then type in **"java -jar tuckshop.jar"**.
    i. That's **java**, space, *dash* **jar**, space, **tuckshop**, period, **jar**.
3. Hit the **Enter**/**Return** key on the keyboard
4. The **tuckshop.jar** file should now execute. See point 12 above.
