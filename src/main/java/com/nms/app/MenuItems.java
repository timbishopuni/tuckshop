 * Class to contain the various menu items and their ingredients present on the menu.
 * Once all orders have been processed, print out all of the data contained in here to a PDF file.
 * 
 * CRITICAL - The data must be summarized via three functions, to enable easy order fulfillment:
 * 1. All Orders - Print out all of the menu item quantities - needed for purchasing
 * 2. All Pizzas - Print out of all pizzas ordered - purchasing
 * 3. All Sandwhiches -More complex. Will need to use the data contained in the Orders class. 
 * 						As the orders are being read, each time a Sandwhich is listed, create a new Sandwhich instance
